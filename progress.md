# Grind-Core RPG: Player Progression Guide

This document outlines the expected progression path for a player in Grind-Core RPG, making assumptions about consistent play.

## Early Game (Levels 1-20, First Hour)

The initial phase is about establishing a foothold, understanding the core loop of missions, and getting your first gear upgrades.

### First 5 Minutes:
- **Zone:** The Cafeteria (Power Req: 1)
- **Actions:** The player starts by running "Short" missions (30s). Each mission grants ~10 XP and ~5 Gold. There's a 10% chance for a `Rusty Sword` or `Leather Tunic`.
- **Goal:** Reach Level 2 (100 XP). This takes 10 short missions, or exactly 5 minutes of continuous play.
- **Outcome:** At Level 2, the player's base power becomes `1 (base) + 2*5 (level) = 11`. This is enough to unlock **The Supermarket** (Power Req: 10). By now, they've likely found at least one piece of common gear, pushing their power to ~15.

### First 15 Minutes:
- **Zone:** The Supermarket (Power Req: 10)
- **Actions:** The player now grinds Supermarket missions (~15 XP).
- **Goal:** Reach Level 4 (500 total XP). This requires `(500 - 100) / 15 = ~27` missions, which is about 13.5 minutes.
- **Outcome:** At Level 4, base power is `1 + 4*5 = 21`. This unlocks the **Public Park** (Power Req: 20). The player should have a few common items by now, with power around 30-35.

### First Hour:
- **Zones:** Public Park, The Gymnasium, Post Office.
- **Actions:** The player continues to push to new zones as their power allows. They will discover **Power Shards** (first one from the Park), a crucial item for permanent power boosts. They will also find their first **Rare** items.
- **Goal:** Reach Level 10-15. Unlock the **Forge** view and begin upgrading equipment. The first boss, **The Lunch Lady's Ghost**, becomes accessible after completing an 8-hour mission in the Cafeteria (likely started overnight or during a break).
- **Outcome:** By the end of the first hour, a dedicated player should have a full set of Common or even some Rare gear, be around Level 12-15, with a Power level approaching 100. They have a grasp of all core mechanics except the Lab.

## Mid Game (Levels 20-50)

This phase is about specialization, optimization, and tackling major threats.

### Boss Hunting:
- As the player completes 8-hour missions in each zone, they unlock the corresponding boss.
- Defeating bosses is a primary source of **Legendary** items (Boss Drops) and high-value reptilian parts for the Lab.
- The 8-hour global cooldown on boss fights makes this a strategic, daily activity.

### The Forge:
- Gold is now primarily funneled into upgrading a solid set of Rare or Epic equipment.
- Players will learn the risk/reward of standard vs. safe upgrades. Getting a key item to +10 is a major milestone.

### The Lab:
- The player will create their first **Homunculus**. They will learn the mechanics of synthesizing creatures from reptilian parts.
- They will start feeding their baby homunculus during its 24-hour hibernation to boost its traits, which contribute directly to player power.
- Once adult, the Homunculus can be assigned to jobs in unlocked zones, generating the game's secondary currency: **USD**.

### Progression:
- The player pushes through zones like the `Data Center`, `Crash Site`, and eventually the `White House`.
- Power levels will range from 500 to over 10,000.
- The player will have a stable of adult Homunculi with specialized traits for different jobs, generating a steady income of USD for the Marketplace.

## Late Game (Levels 50+)

The endgame is about min-maxing, completing collections, and pushing the limits of power.

### Ultimate Power:
- **The Forge:** Getting a full set of Legendary gear to +15 is the ultimate goal. This requires immense amounts of Gold and luck. The max-level perks provide significant boosts.
- **The Lab:** Players will be creating multiple Legendary Homunculi, carefully feeding them to max out their traits (10 points in each). This provides a massive, permanent power boost.
- **Collections:** Completing all item collections for zones provides permanent power bonuses, which are essential for reaching the highest power levels.

### The Final Frontier:
- The player will be tackling the final, high-power zones like the `Bloodmoon Wasteland` and `So-called Heaven`.
- Bosses in these zones are incredibly tough, requiring tens of thousands of power to defeat reliably.
- The player will be competing for the top spots on the global leaderboards. A late-game player's power can reach into the hundreds of thousands, or even millions.
